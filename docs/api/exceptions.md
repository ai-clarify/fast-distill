# Exceptions

This section contains the `fastdistill` custom exceptions. Unlike [errors](errors.md), exceptions in `fastdistill` are used to handle specific situations that can be anticipated and that can be handled in a controlled way internally by the library.

:::fastdistill.exceptions.FastDistillException
:::fastdistill.exceptions.FastDistillGenerationException
:::fastdistill.exceptions.FastDistillOfflineBatchGenerationNotFinishedException

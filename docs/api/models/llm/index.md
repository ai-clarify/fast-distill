# LLM

This section contains the API reference for the `fastdistill` LLMs, both for the [`LLM`][fastdistill.models.llms.LLM] synchronous implementation, and for the [`AsyncLLM`][fastdistill.models.llms.AsyncLLM] asynchronous one.

For more information and examples on how to use existing LLMs or create custom ones, please refer to [Tutorial - LLM](../../../sections/how_to_guides/basic/llm/index.md).

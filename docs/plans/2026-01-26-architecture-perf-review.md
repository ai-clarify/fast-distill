# Plan: Architecture and performance review with improvements

Date: 2026-01-26

## Context
- Request: scan the repo for architecture/performance pain points, document findings, and implement improvements.
- Constraints: follow engineering practices, update progress in this plan, run full lint + tests, and commit changes.

## Plan
1. Survey pipeline/runtime code paths and note architecture or performance concerns.
2. Capture findings + proposed fixes in the FastDistill performance docs (EN + ZH).
3. Implement a concrete improvement with tests.
4. Run lint, unit tests, and integration tests.
5. Update plan progress and commit changes (small commits preferred).

## Progress
- [x] Reviewed engineering practices in `docs/ENGINEERING_PRACTICES.md`.
- [x] Surveyed code paths and drafted findings.
- [x] Updated documentation (EN + ZH) with review and actions.
- [x] Implemented improvements with tests.
- [x] Ran full lint and tests.
- [x] Committed changes.

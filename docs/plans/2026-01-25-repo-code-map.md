# Plan: Repository code map overview

Date: 2026-01-25

## Context
- User requested an explanation of what all code in the project does.
- Goal: provide a systematic, accurate map of modules, key responsibilities, and how pieces fit.

## Plan
1. Scan repository structure and list primary code areas.
2. Read key package entry points and top-level modules to confirm responsibilities.
3. Summarize each directory/module at a high level (no line-by-line), noting entry points and tests.
4. Update plan progress and commit plan file.

## Progress
- [x] Reviewed engineering practices in `docs/ENGINEERING_PRACTICES.md`.
- [ ] Scanned repo structure and key modules.
- [ ] Produced code map summary for user.
- [ ] Committed plan file.

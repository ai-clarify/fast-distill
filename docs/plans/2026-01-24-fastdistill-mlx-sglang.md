# FastDistill MLX + SGLang coding support (2026-01-24)

## Scope
Start coding MLX export/training hooks and SGLang runtime usage so the pipeline can
generate distilled datasets and run against SGLang or MLX-backed students.

## Steps
- [ ] Add an MLX dataset export step (JSONL) and wire it into a reference pipeline.
- [ ] Add/extend examples for SGLang runtime usage.
- [ ] Add MLX docs (export + training entrypoints) in EN/中文.
- [ ] Tests for the new MLX export step.
- [ ] Commit + push.

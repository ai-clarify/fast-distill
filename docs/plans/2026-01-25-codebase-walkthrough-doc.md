# Plan: Codebase walkthrough documentation

Date: 2026-01-25

## Context
- User requested a from-shallow-to-deep interpretation of the entire codebase.
- Deliverable: documentation page(s) that map modules, execution flow, and extension points.
- Must update docs navigation, run full lint + tests, and commit.

## Plan
1. Survey key entry points and core modules to build an accurate mental model.
2. Draft a layered walkthrough doc (English + Chinese) with file pointers and flow diagrams.
3. Wire the new docs into mkdocs navigation and cross-link from developer docs.
4. Run lint + unit + integration tests; fix issues if any.
5. Update plan progress and commit.

## Progress
- [x] Reviewed engineering practices in `docs/ENGINEERING_PRACTICES.md`.
- [x] Surveyed key entry points and core modules.
- [x] Drafted layered walkthrough docs (EN + ZH).
- [x] Updated mkdocs navigation and cross-links.
- [x] Ran lint + unit + integration tests.
- [ ] Committed changes.

# Plan: Distillation papers survey notes

Date: 2026-01-26

## Context
- Add a curated list of distillation-related papers to the repo.
- Provide both English and Chinese docs for the new FastDistill section.

## Plan
1. Review engineering practices and existing FastDistill docs structure.
2. Gather authoritative sources for distillation papers (foundational, transformer/LLM distillation, dataset distillation, surveys).
3. Draft English + Chinese docs with a compact table and short annotations.
4. Run lint + unit + integration tests.
5. Commit only the new docs (and any required README/nav updates).

## Progress
- [x] Review engineering practices and docs structure.
- [x] Gather sources for distillation papers.
- [x] Draft English + Chinese docs with per-paper interpretations.
- [ ] Run lint + unit + integration tests (skipped: doc-only change per user).
- [ ] Commit changes.

## Notes
- Keep links in markdown tables; avoid JSON examples in docs.
